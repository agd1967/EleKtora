Electronic platform to analyse the electoral behaviour in Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada. 
This is the source code to EleKtora, an electronic platform to analyse the electoral behaviour in Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada. The aim of this project is to create an electronic platform of electoral graphical statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada, to provide information on electoral trends and behavior, progress and setbacks in electoral systems and processes, in terms of participation and the right to vote as a human right. This is a tool for the public, researchers, politicians and experts, as well as for the accompaniment electoral missions of the centre.
It is developed using PHP, HTML5, Javascript and Highcharts. Data is extracted from MySql, and it is currently under development on Python using Flask.
I hope it can help anyone, and also attract constructive criticism and support.
